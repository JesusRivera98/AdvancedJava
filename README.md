## General info
In this course we learn more advanced concepts of Java SE including:
- JavaDocs
- Tags
- Nested classes
- Nested class instances
- Enumerations
- Inheritance in interfaces
- Error handling
- Map types
- APIs
- JDBC - System to manage databases with Java
- Lambdas - Adapt and declare functions at the time of use

The final result of this project was a modification of a previous system in which the visualization of movies, books and series was handled, adding modularity and creating cleaner code by implementing the concepts mentioned above.
